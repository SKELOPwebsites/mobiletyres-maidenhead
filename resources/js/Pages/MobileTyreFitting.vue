                            At <b>Mobile Tyres Beaconsfield</b>, we understand the importance of having properly functioning and safe tyres on your vehicle.
                            If you have a sidewall puncture, it is important to replace the tyre as soon as possible.

                            Sidewall punctures, or punctures that occur on the sidewall of a tyre, are typically not repairable and require a new tyre.
                            This is because the sidewall of a tyre is an essential structural component that supports the weight of the vehicle and helps provide stability and handling.
                            When a sidewall puncture occurs, it can weaken the integrity of the tyre and make it unsafe to use.
