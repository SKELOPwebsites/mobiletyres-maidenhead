                        <p class="text-sm">
                            At <b>Mobile Tyres Beaconsfield</b>, we are dedicated to helping our customers keep their tyres in good condition and ensure
                            the safety and performance of their vehicles. If you have a punctured tyre, you may be wondering if it is repairable or if you need to replace it.
                            Here are a few things to consider when determining whether your punctured tyre is repairable:
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <ul class="list-disc text-sm pl-6 space-y-2">
                            <li><u>The location:</u> A tyre can only be repaired if the damage is located in the central Â¾ of the tyre.</li>
                            <li><u>The size:</u> If the puncture is too large or deep, it may not be repairable.</li>
                            <li><u>The age & condition:</u> Even if a puncture is repairable, it may be more cost-effective to replace the tyre if it is old or has other issues such as tread wear or sidewall damage.</li>
                            <li><u>The tyre:</u> Run-flats are not repairable due to the reinforcement in the sidewall</li>
                        </ul>
                        <br>
                        <p class="text-sm">
                            If your tyre is repairable, make sure that you do not drive on that flat tyre to maximise the chance
                            of repairing it. This is because there is no air pressure to keep the tyre shaped
                            correctly and the tyre sidewall will be pinched between the wheel rim and the road which can gravely damage it.
                        </p>

                            Puncture repairs are only a temporary solution - there is still a chance that your tyre
                            may start to leak air again, especially if you've repaired the same tyre once before.

                            We understand that tyre purchases can be a significant investment, however it can be more cost-efficient to go for
                            a brand new tyre, as it will most likely last longer than the old tyre and give you better performance and reliability.

                            <li>If the tread on your tyres is worn down to the minimum tread depth of 1.6mm or lower, it is time to replace them.</li>
                            <li>If you notice bulges or blisters on the sidewalls of your tyres, it means the tyre has internal damage and needs to be replaced.</li>
                            <li>Tyres with visible cracks or cuts in the sidewall or tread are at risk of failing and should be replaced as soon as possible.</li>
                            <li>Uneven tyre wear may indicate a problem with your vehicle's alignment or suspension. Consider replacing the tyres if necessary after having the issue checked by a mechanic.</li>
                            <li>Tyres have a limited lifespan and should be replaced after a certain number of years, even if the tread is still good. Most tyres should be replaced after 6-10 years.</li>
